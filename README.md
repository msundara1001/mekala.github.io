My goal is to to help you gain modelling and quantitative competency.
Here is what you can find on my statistics webpage:
1. My SSDM R codes to plot and forecast maps
2. Creating custom resampling routines
3. Phylogenetic Variance Partioning

Hidden in my code are little snipets of animal sayings. If you find them, I know you were following along. Your first step is 
```yml
install.packages('cowsay')
library(cowsay)
say("catfact", "cat")
```
